- Welcome to Traction, by Jonathan, Emmanuel, Corey, Levi and Kyle. Built using React, Redux, Node, Express and PostGres, along with continious deployment through Netlify and Heroku, the idea behind Traction is to provide users with a simple way to schedule their monthly workouts and log their fitness progress in one place. Paper notebooks and schedules become a thing of the past with the help of Traction!
